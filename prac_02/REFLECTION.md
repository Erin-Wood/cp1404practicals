# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

50%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I try to see up an hour or two for watching the lectures, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and always in the afternoon. Usually I'll watch them in the JCU library (because I'm easily distracted by things at home), however I try and have a uni day at home.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far, I understand the basics with what the code is meant to do and how the code does its thing.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Luckily for me it was explained that although there is a seminar every Thursday, you have to watch the lectures before hand. So now I am making a conscience effort to watch the lectures.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I'm having trouble with putting the programing into action, I understand how the code works (to an extent) but I'm not sure on how to do the actual coding. It is only week two, so hopefully this improves.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I mean I turn up on time, so its a start; hoever as for what I'm doing really well? I'm still figuring it out.
